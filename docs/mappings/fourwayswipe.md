# Charge up 4-way swipe (Multi-Skill)

The `Charge up 4-way swipe (Multi-Skill)` is a combined mapping key that integrates long-pressing and swiping in different directions. It is widely used in **fighting** and **football** games. You can assign separate keys to the center and up to 4 different directions (a maximum of 8 directions). At least one key must be assigned to the center or one of the directions.

For example:
Long-press the center `shortcut` to charge, then press one of the directional `shortcut` to trigger a swipe in that direction.
You can also directly press a directional `shortcut` to trigger a swipe in that direction.
