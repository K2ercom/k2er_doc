# Recoil Control

`Recoil Control` is used in conjunction with the `Aiming mode` or `Camera stick`, typically in shooting games, to assist in managing the recoil of firearms.

## Parameters

* **Binding fire shortcut**: Typically the `Left Mouse Button`, or `R2` for gamepads.

* **Control Frequency**: The number of controls applied per second.

* **Control Strength**: Multiple strengths can be added. Each time the shortcut key is pressed, the strength will switch. You can also enable `Mouse wheel change level` to change strength with mouse wheel.

* **Mouse wheel change level**: Use the mouse wheel to quickly switch between the current strength levels.

* **Shake**: Random horizontal shaking.

* **Override Sensitivity**: Overrides the aiming sensitivity when recoil control is activated.
