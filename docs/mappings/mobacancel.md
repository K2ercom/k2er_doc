# MOBA Cancel Key

The `MOBA Cancel Key` is used in conjunction with the `MOBA Skill Key` or `MOBA Skill Key (Stick)` to cancel skill casting during the skill aiming process.

Only one `MOBA Cancel Key` can be set. If the cancel position of the skill is not unified, please set the `Private Cancel Position` in the `MOBA Skill Key` or `MOBA Skill Key (Stick)` settings.
