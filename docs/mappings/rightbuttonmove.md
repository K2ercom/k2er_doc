# Right Button Move

`Right Button Move` allows the player to control the in-game virtual joystick by clicking the `Right Mouse Button` on the screen. It is typically used in `MOBA` games. To use it, configure `Right Button Move` at the location of the virtual joystick in the game.

A single click of the `Right Mouse Button` triggers a one-time movement. Holding down the `Right Mouse Button` triggers continuous movement.

## Parameters

* **Radius**: Adjusts the size of the **virtual joystick**.

* **Virtual Center**: The vector from the `Virtual Center` to the position where the `Right Mouse Button` is pressed determines the direction and duration of the virtual joystick's movement.

* **Time Factor**: The larger the value, the longer the one-time movement triggered by the right click lasts.

* **Stop Movement on Release**: When enabled, after holding down the `Right Mouse Button` for continuous movement, the movement stops immediately when the `Right Mouse Button` is released.

* **Stop Movement Shortcut**: Pressing this `Shortcut` immediately stops the movement.
